Water or simpler chemicals, like certain molecules, may hold potential for qubits, though the current state of quantum computing primarily relies on systems like superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photons. One reason water is unlikely to be a straightforward candidate for qubits is its inherent complexity in terms of quantum states. Water molecules are already a relatively "noisy" system due to their vibrational and rotational modes. In quantum computing, qubits need to be in highly controlled and isolated states to maintain coherence, which is difficult with a molecule as complex as H₂O. The interactions between water molecules and their surrounding environment lead to rapid decoherence, making them less ideal as stable quantum bits.

However, simpler chemicals, such as specific atomic ions or spin systems in organic molecules, are being explored in quantum information processing. For example, certain organic molecules, like nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, or molecular spin qubits, have shown potential. These molecules can store quantum information in the spins of electrons or nuclei, which are less susceptible to decoherence when properly controlled. These simpler chemical systems, when engineered with high precision, can be manipulated using lasers or magnetic fields to perform quantum computations.

The challenge with using water or similar substances in qubit development stems from maintaining quantum coherence long enough to perform meaningful computations. Chemical compounds tend to have a high degree of entanglement with their surroundings, and water’s constant molecular motion poses a significant hurdle. While theoretically intriguing, the use of simpler chemicals like certain molecules may be a more promising route, provided new methods of quantum control and error correction are developed. Researchers continue to explore how chemical systems at the molecular level can be utilized for quantum computing, but water itself is unlikely to be a practical solution in the foreseeable future.
