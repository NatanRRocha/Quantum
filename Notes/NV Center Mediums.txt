Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are most commonly studied in diamond due to diamondâ€™s exceptional material properties, including a wide bandgap, high thermal conductivity, and low spin-orbit coupling, which contribute to the long coherence times observed in NV-based qubits. However, researchers have explored alternative host materials that can support similar defect-based qubits with comparable or even enhanced properties. One such alternative is silicon carbide (SiC), a material that has gained attention for its ability to host defect centers analogous to NV centers in diamond. Silicon carbide benefits from its established use in the semiconductor industry, making it a more scalable option for integration into existing fabrication technologies. NV-like defects in SiC, such as the silicon-vacancy (SiV) and divacancy centers, exhibit spin coherence properties that are promising for quantum computing, sensing, and communication applications. Additionally, SiC can be synthesized and processed using well-developed techniques from semiconductor manufacturing, reducing the cost and complexity associated with diamond-based qubit fabrication.

Beyond silicon carbide, other wide-bandgap materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), have been explored for hosting quantum defects with optical and spin properties similar to NV centers. Hexagonal boron nitride, a layered van der Waals material, can sustain optically active spin defects that exhibit room-temperature quantum coherence, making it a compelling candidate for scalable quantum systems. Unlike bulk diamond, hBN can be exfoliated into thin layers, potentially allowing for more flexible and tunable quantum device architectures. The ability to integrate hBN quantum defects with photonic and electronic platforms opens up new opportunities for hybrid quantum technologies, such as integrated quantum sensors and distributed quantum networks. Furthermore, researchers have begun engineering defect centers in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other two-dimensional (2D) materials, exploring their potential as hosts for solid-state qubits with unique properties that differ from bulk diamond systems.

While NV centers in diamond remain the gold standard for defect-based quantum technologies, ongoing research into alternative host materials aims to overcome some of diamond's limitations, such as its challenging fabrication and growth processes. Materials like SiC and hBN provide opportunities to create more scalable, cost-effective, and adaptable quantum devices, enabling wider adoption in both fundamental research and practical applications. The ability to engineer NV-like defects in different host materials could lead to tailored quantum properties optimized for specific tasks, such as enhanced coupling to photonic systems, improved coherence times, or more efficient integration with existing semiconductor technologies. As research continues, the development of NV-like centers in new materials will likely play a crucial role in advancing the next generation of quantum computing, communication, and sensing technologies.
