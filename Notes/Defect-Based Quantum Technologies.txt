Defect-based quantum technologies utilize imperfections, or point defects, in crystalline materials to create stable qubits and quantum sensors. These defects occur when an atom is missing or replaced within a lattice structure, creating localized electronic states that can be exploited for quantum applications. NV centers in diamond are a prime example of a defect-based qubit, where a nitrogen atom replaces a carbon atom adjacent to a vacancy, forming a spin system that can be optically initialized, manipulated, and read out. Other defect-based qubits include silicon-vacancy (SiV) and germanium-vacancy (GeV) centers in diamond, divacancies in silicon carbide (SiC), and defects in two-dimensional materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). These defects serve as stable, solid-state quantum systems that can operate in ambient or near-ambient conditions, making them practical alternatives to other qubit platforms like superconducting circuits or trapped ions.

Defect-based quantum technologies are particularly valuable for quantum sensing, where they enable ultra-precise detection of magnetic fields, electric fields, temperature variations, and pressure changes. NV centers in diamond, for example, can function as nanoscale magnetometers, detecting minuscule changes in magnetic fields with high spatial resolution. This capability is essential for applications in biomedical imaging, material science, and fundamental physics experiments. In quantum communication, defect-based qubits provide a robust spin-photon interface, allowing for quantum entanglement distribution in secure communication networks. Moreover, defect centers integrated into nanophotonic structures enhance light-matter interactions, improving quantum information processing efficiency. As research progresses, defect-based quantum technologies are expected to play a critical role in scalable quantum computing, hybrid quantum-classical systems, and advanced quantum cryptographic protocols.
