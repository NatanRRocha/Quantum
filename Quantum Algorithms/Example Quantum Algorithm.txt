Algorithm: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)

Description:
Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a fundamental quantum algorithm used to estimate the eigenvalues of a unitary operator. It is crucial for many quantum algorithms, including Shorâ€™s factoring algorithm and applications in quantum chemistry.

Steps:
1. Initialize \( n \) control qubits in the \( |0\rangle \) state and a target qubit in the eigenstate \( |\psi\rangle \).
2. Apply Hadamard gates to all \( n \) control qubits to create a superposition state.
3. Use controlled-unitary operations to apply \( U^{2^j} \) on the target qubit, where \( U \) is the unitary whose phase we want to estimate.
4. Perform an inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) on the control qubits to extract the phase information.
5. Measure the control qubits to obtain an estimate of the phase.

Quantum Circuit Representation:
- Apply Hadamard gates: \( H^{\otimes n} |0\rangle^{\otimes n} \)
- Controlled unitary operations: \( CU^{2^j} \)
- Apply inverse QFT: \( QFT^{-1} \)
- Measure the qubits.

Mathematical Formulation:
Given \( U |\psi\rangle = e^{2\pi i \theta} |\psi\rangle \), the algorithm estimates \( \theta \) by encoding it in the probability amplitudes of the measured qubits.

Complexity:
The algorithm requires \( O(n) \) qubits and \( O(n^2) \) operations, making it efficient for problems where eigenvalue estimation is crucial.

Use Case:
Quantum Phase Estimation is widely used in quantum computing for solving problems in physics, chemistry, and cryptography.
