Superquantum computing remains a purely theoretical concept with no experimental validation because it is not based on any currently known physical systems or realizable computational frameworks. Unlike classical and quantum computing, which have well-established mathematical models and experimental implementations, superquantum computing exists mostly as a speculative extension of quantum mechanics. Theoretical discussions about superquantum computation often involve concepts such as nonlocal correlations beyond quantum entanglement, computational models leveraging higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, or even physics inspired by quantum gravity. However, no physical system or controlled experiment has ever demonstrated computational behavior that exceeds the limits of known quantum mechanics. Without experimental confirmation, the idea of superquantum computing remains in the realm of hypothetical physics and computational philosophy rather than practical science.

One of the fundamental reasons for the lack of experimental validation is that quantum mechanics already defines the known limits of computation based on physical laws. Quantum mechanics sets boundaries on the strength of correlations (such as those described by Bell inequalities) and the speed of information processing (such as the no-signaling principle). The computational power of quantum computers is formally characterized within complexity classes like BQP (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial Time), and no experimental evidence has suggested that any physical system can efficiently compute beyond this class. While alternative models of computation, such as quantum gravity-inspired algorithms or exotic topological systems, have been proposed, they remain speculative because no experimental framework currently exists to test or validate them. Any claim of superquantum computational power would require strong empirical evidence demonstrating a fundamental violation of quantum mechanical limits, which has not been observed in any laboratory.

Furthermore, even if superquantum computation were theoretically possible, there is no known physical mechanism to construct a device that could harness such computational power. Quantum computing is based on well-defined principles, such as qubit manipulation, quantum gates, and error correction, all of which have been demonstrated in laboratories using superconducting circuits, trapped ions, photonic systems, and other experimental setups. In contrast, superquantum computation lacks any hardware model, feasible physical substrate, or experimental proposal that could lead to a working device. The closest theoretical analogs, such as PR (Popescu-Rohrlich) boxes, which exhibit stronger-than-quantum nonlocality, are purely mathematical constructs and do not exist in the real world. Without an experimentally realizable platform, superquantum computation remains purely a conceptual idea with no practical implementation pathway.

Finally, the absence of experimental validation is also due to the lack of a coherent theoretical framework that extends quantum mechanics in a computationally meaningful way. While researchers explore ideas from quantum gravity, string theory, and other advanced fields, there is no unified theory that predicts computational behavior beyond quantum mechanics. Even speculative proposals, such as black hole information processing or holographic computing, do not provide concrete methods to construct a superquantum computer. Theoretical physics is still struggling to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity, and without such a unification, the idea of computation beyond quantum limits is premature and untestable. In science, theories must be tested and falsified through experimentation, and until a breakthrough in physics provides a viable path for empirical validation, superquantum computing will remain an intriguing but purely hypothetical concept.
