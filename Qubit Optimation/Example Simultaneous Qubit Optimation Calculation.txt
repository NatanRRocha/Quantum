Simultaneous Qubit Optimation Calculation

Initial Conditions:

Let three qubits exist in superposition with the following initial amplitudes:

Q1 = [ 0.6 + 0.2i ]      Q2 = [ 0.5 + 0.5i ]      Q3 = [ 0.7 + 0.3i ]
     [ 0.8 - 0.1i ]           [ 0.5 - 0.5i ]           [ 0.6 - 0.2i ]

The optimation process balances fidelity (F) and decoherence mitigation (D), initialized as:

F = 0.7,   D = 0.3

Quantum Gate Transformations:

Apply a Hadamard gate (H) and a Phase shift gate (P), weighted by F and D:

H = (1/√2) * [ 1  1 ]     P = [ 1     0 ]
              [ 1 -1 ]         [ 0  e^(iπ/4) ]

The transformation at each iteration updates each qubit Qn as:

Qn' = (F * (H * Qn) + D * (P * Qn)) / ||F * (H * Qn) + D * (P * Qn)||

where ||·|| ensures normalization.

Iterative Adjustments:

At each iteration (t), update weights dynamically:

F_{t+1} = 0.95 * F_t
D_{t+1} = 1.05 * D_t

Repeat for 5 iterations, updating qubit states each time.

Explanation:

Simultaneous optimation for qubits in superposition dynamically adjusts the fidelity and decoherence weighting factors during quantum computation. Initially, the system prioritizes gate fidelity to ensure accurate quantum transformations while applying a lower weighting for decoherence mitigation. Over multiple iterations, as the quantum system evolves, the fidelity weight slightly decreases while the decoherence weight increases to compensate for environmental noise effects. This allows the system to maintain a balance between computational efficiency and stability. By applying a combination of the Hadamard and phase shift gates, the optimation process iteratively refines each qubit’s state, ensuring optimal superposition and entanglement properties for reliable quantum computation.

The iterative nature of optimation enables quantum algorithms to dynamically adjust their parameters based on real-time conditions, rather than relying on fixed optimization strategies. This is particularly crucial for near-term quantum devices, where noise and errors must be actively managed. The ability to adapt weightings ensures that the computation remains robust, even under fluctuating hardware conditions. This approach is applicable in quantum variational algorithms, error correction strategies, and hybrid quantum-classical models, where a fine-tuned balance between computational depth and system stability is essential for maximizing quantum performance.
